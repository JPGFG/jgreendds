      <h3>Why do you need to know my medical history?</h3>
      <p>
        When you become one of our patients, we will first ask you to complete a
        full medical history form. The form covers your medical health and
        history in detail, and asks about areas of the body that may seem
        unrelated to your dental health. However, we ask that you complete the
        forms as honestly and thoroughly as possible. The entire body works as a
        unit, and your oral health is intricately connected to the rest of you.
        Not having a complete medical history may result in dental treatment
        having adverse or unexpected effects. There are also oral manifestations
        of various systemic diseases that may lead to a delay in proper
        diagnosis without a full medical history. For a copy of our medical
        history form, please click the link below.

        Why is it important to give you a complete list of my medications?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A complete list of medications and their doses is an important part of
        your medical history. Many medications have side effects that will
        effect the health and appearance of your oral tissues. If we are aware
        of your medications, it may help us to explain certain oral conditions.
        More importantly, knowing your medications will help us to avoid writing
        prescriptions and doing procedures that would have an adverse reaction
        with what you are currently taking.

      <h3>How do you sterilize your instruments?</h3>
      <p>
        Our instruments are processed after each patient using a multi-step
        process which includes both cleaning and sterilization. Instruments are
        first cleaned- meaning all debris is removed from the instrument-
        through either ultrasonic vibration, chemical treatment or scrubbing.
        The instruments are then sterilized -which means that all living
        organisms are killed- with the use of moist heat and pressurization.
        When possible, disposable items will be used.
      </p>
      <h3>How often should I have my teeth cleaned?</h3>
      <p>
        As a general guideline, we recommend that most patients visit the office
        for a cleaning and exam twice a year. However, we may adjust our
        recommendation based on your dental health, your habits, and your
        preferences.{" "}

      <h3>
        I have silver fillings. Should I be concerned about mercury poisoning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In a word- no. Amalgam fillings do contain a small amount of mercury.
        This has been a source of concern for many patients. The amount of
        mercury exposure, however, is well below what would be harmful to
        humans. Furthermore, removing old amalgam fillings because of concerns
        for mercury poisoning is not recommended, as the highest levels of
        exposure are on the day the filling is placed, and the day it is
        removed.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>Do I really need X-rays?</h3>
      <p>
        For the majority of our patients the answer is yes. Although we will not
        force anyone to have any procedure done that they object to, it is
        important to understand that X-rays are a very important tool in the
        diagnosis and treatment of dental problems. The amount of radiation in
        dental x-rays is very small, and the benefits far outweigh the risks.
        Without x-rays, it is often impossible for us to diagnose cavities and
        other issues while they are small and easily dealt with.
      </p>
      <h3>Don’t x-rays cost a small fortune?</h3>
      <p>
        If you are concerned about the cost of any procedure, please feel free
        to ask. Unfortunately, there seems to be a myth that x-rays are
        astronomically expensive. Although it is understood that each person
        lives by a different budget, the most common dental x-rays are about
        $50.{" "}

      <h3>Should my child be given a fluoride treatment?</h3>
      <p>
        We recommend that all children under the age of 14 receive a fluoride
        treatment at each of their cleaning appointments. Fluoride is beneficial
        both in the ingested form (such as in drinking water or with a fluoride
        vitamin) and topical form (such as in toothpaste and fluoride
        treatments). Ingested fluoride strengthens teeth that are yet to erupt,
        and topical fluoride strengthens the teeth that are already present in
        the mouth. Although it is true that too much ingested fluoride can cause
        problems, fluoride given in a measured dose has been shown to reduce
        tooth decay by 40-60%. Our fluoride treatments are given in the form of
        a fluoride varnish, which is a very safe and effective way to deliver a
        measured dose of topical fluoride to your child’s teeth.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>Does my water at home have fluoride in it?</h3>
      <p>
        Fluoride in the community water supply is a safe and effective way to
        deliver a measured dose of ingested fluoride to children. Fluoride does
        not occur naturally in the ground water of this area at a level which
        benefits oral health. However, some municipalities have added fluoride
        to their water supply. Of course, don’t forget- many of us drink bottled
        water. If your child is drinking exclusively bottled water, this may
        change the amount of fluoride he or she is receiving.
      </p>
      <h3>Is it bad for me to have fluoride in my drinking water?</h3>
      <p>
        Recently, a popular TV talk show host ran a segment on the evils of
        fluoride in our drinking water. Understandably, this type of thing
        causes concern to those watching. However, the claims presented during
        this television segment showed an alarming lack of scientific evidence
        supporting them.ollowing the segment, the CDC, ADA, ADHA and the Harvard
        School of Dental Medicine all released statements on the safety and
        effectiveness of fluoride in our drinking water. In fact, the CDC has
        named community water fluoridation to be one of the 10 great public
        health achievements of the 20th century.

      <h3>What does my insurance cover?</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to find out what your insurance covers is to contact your
        insurance company, or to check the paperwork provided to you by your
        insurance company. We will be happy to tell you what most insurance
        companies commonly cover. However, each individual policy is different-
        even within the same company.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>When should I bring my child in for his/her first cleaning?</h3>
      <p>
        We recommend bringing your child to visit us starting at age 3. Although
        many 3 year old children are not at all interested in actually getting
        their teeth cleaned, it is an important life experience. We will make
        the visit as pleasant as possible, explaining ourselves every step of
        the way. We want your child to have an enjoyable experience as much as
        you do. What we want to avoid is the unfortunate experience in which an
        older child (or adult!) has never had a pleasant visit with the dentist,
        and can only associate dental visits with toothaches and trauma. If your
        child is less than 3 years old, and you feel that he or she has a dental
        issue- such as a discolored tooth, or dental trauma, please contact one
        of the very qualified pediatric dentists in the area. They will also be
        happy to provide cleaning and preventive care to even the youngest of
        patients.{" "}

      <h3>What electric toothbrush is best?</h3>
      <p>
        Although not everyone needs an electric toothbrush, they certainly are a
        great tool for improving your oral health. If you have periodontal
        disease, a tendency to develop staining, a tendency to be too aggressive
        while brushing or a disability which prevents you from being effective
        with a manual toothbrush, an electric toothbrush could be the key to a
        healthy mouth. Besides, even those of us who don’t need an electric
        toothbrush will love the super clean feeling you’ll have when you use
        one. When choosing a toothbrush, be sure to find one that is easy to
        keep clean, has a rechargeable battery, and has a small head. At our
        office, we sell Sonicare toothbrushes, but we also like several Oral B
        models. Be sure to ask which one is best for you at your next
        appointment.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>What kind of toothpaste should I use?</h3>
      <p>
        There are so many different toothpastes on the market, it’s a bit
        overwhelming. The answer to which is best really depends on the
        individual. When you visit us for your cleaning and check up, we will be
        happy to guide you as to which toothpaste works best for your individual
        needs.

      <h3>
        I’m leaving the area, and would like my records transferred. How can I
        get them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although we’ll be sad to see you go, we’ll be happy to help you out.
        We’ll need the name, address, email address and phone number of your new
        dentist, along with a signed letter from you requesting the records
        transfer. Please allow at least a week for all current x-rays to be
        copied and sent.{" "}
